Basic Scala Code Snippets
=========================

First, install the [Scala Build Tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) for your platform. Clone this
repo and change your directory to the rootfor the repo. Run `sbt` to get the `sbt:ScalaIntro` prompt.
Type `run` at the prompt to see the available main classes to run.

Here are some resources to get you started:

#. Scala's [Getting Started page](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started.html)
#. You can test short programs using [scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/), an interactive playground for Scala
#. The Scala library's [API documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/)

There are many IDEs (VSCode, Atom, IntelliJ IDEA and emacs) to choose from. Good luck.
