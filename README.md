Basic Scala Code Snippets
=========================

First, install the [Scala Build Tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) for your platform. Clone this
repo and change your directory to the rootfor the repo. Run `sbt` to get the `sbt:ScalaIntro` prompt.
Type `run` at the prompt to see the available main classes to run.

Here are some resources to get you started:

* Scala's [Getting Started page](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started.html)
* You can test short programs using [scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/), an interactive playground for Scala
* The Scala library's [API documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/)
* Some 99 problem inspired functional [puzzles](https://github.com/davidmweber/puzzle_time) 
  and their [solutions](https://github.com/davidmweber/puzzle_solutions) for your entertainment,

There are many IDEs (VSCode, Atom, IntelliJ IDEA and emacs) to choose from. Good luck.

Here are some tutorials to get you started:
* [Scala Tutorials](https://scalatutorials.com) have a clean and simple interactive tutorial
* For a full blown language tutorial based on IntelliJ, use [All About Scala](https://allaboutscala.com)
* [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/) has a good and complete coverage of the language
* [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org) is an online interactive compiler that lets you test things out
* The brave can take on Coursera's [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1).
  It is time consuming (5 hours a week) and aimed at those who really want to understand functional thinking. 
  It is also the lead into advanced concurrency and data at scale Scala courses.
